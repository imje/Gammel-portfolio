                "Most teachers think that digital tools are good, but the problem is that not everyone knows how to use them.‚Äù
                <br><br>
                As it is today, teachers have to seek out digital tools themselves, and
                they often end up using those they already know. The teachers
                are often not aware of all the different ways they can use
                a digital tool, and therefore, they do not get to make full use of its
                potential.

                <br><br>

                It is also difficult to get an overview of available
                digital tools and it can be difficult to find
                information about how they are used for teaching.
                So, the problem is that although most teachers think that digital
                tools are good, not everyone knows how to use them.

        <h2 class=" mb-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">Research</h2>

        <p>
            Through interviews with teachers, we found that digital tools are a good way to organize teaching and
            tasks for each individual student. It will also be less visible to the other students which of them will get accommodated
            tasks, which can take away some of the negative attention this brings.

            <br><br>

            Digital tools in school can provide many different opportunities in teaching, but teachers do not always have
            the knowledge to use them. Little information can lead to the digital tools not being used optimally, 
            or not used at all.
            It can also lead to the teacher spending unnecessary amount of time finding information. That
            they spend a lot of time finding this information should not be necessary, and teachers could always have more
            time for preparation.

            <br><br>

            Based on this, I concluded with two important elements:

            <li>
                Time
            </li>
            <li>
                Information
            </li>
        </p>
    </div>

        <!--Process-->

        <div class="place-content-center pb-20 lg:px-20 px-6">
            <h2 class=" mb-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">Process</h2>

            <p class="pb-10">
                When I was going to start on a solution, it was important to provide knowledge about digital tools by collecting
                information in one place. It then becomes easier for the teacher to use digital tools as they do not have to look for
                this information themselves, and they save time.

                <br><br>

                After designing a proposal for a website, I user-tested this and received positive feedback on if it
                was useful and something they would use. I also received feedback on some features that should be added, and
                after a few iterations i arrived at the solution.
            </p>

        <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">The solution</h2>
        <p>
            The solution saves teachers time, it gives teachers easy access to information about digital tools, and it
            allowing them to discover new tools they would not have found if they did not see them on this website.
            
            <br><br>

            More time to spare, more digital tools, and better use of them, can then lead to better organization and planning of
            the teaching of each individual student.
            <br><br><br><br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-4 text-xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">Main page</h3>
                <p>
                    The solution to the problem was a website where all the digital
                    the tools used in the school are collected. When you enter the
                    website, all the digital tools appear with a logo and a
                    short descriptive title, instead of name, so that even those who have not
                    used the tool before knows what it can be used for (E.g. "Have a quiz" instead
                    of "Kahoot!").

                    <br><br>

                    You can also sort them by
                    category. So if a teacher is looking
                    after a communication tool they can
                    press "Communication" at the top. Other categories can, for example
                    be "Games", "Tasks", "Creative", "Present", etc.

                    <br><br>
                    
                    I made this prototype for PC, so when you
                    hover over a box with a digital tool, you will get three choices. (You can change the way this menu work if the website is to be used on a tablet
                    or a mobile phone).

                    The first choice in the tool menu is "To website".
                    If you press this, the website
                    to the digital tool will open in a new tab. 
                    <br><br>
                    The second choice is "How to use". Here you are taken to a
                    new page that explains in a simple way, step by step and
                    with video, how the digital tool is used.
                    In addition, you get a concrete example you can follow
                    to learn it in practice.
